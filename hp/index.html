	<meta property='og:description' content='á… á… Hi all. Nameâ€™s Maya A. Baronova, yet Iâ€™m more accustomed to being called Â«ItsformeÂ» or just Â«ItsÂ» while online.
á… á… I can do basic communication in English, but often find myself mismatching words or failing to convey a simple ideaâ€Šâ€”â€Šexcuse me and donâ€™t be too harsh if I freeze dumbfounded once in a while. A little bit of broken French too, so we can try this as well si vous avÃ©z une patience angÃ©lique, voilÃ . However, my mother language is crippling shyness Russian.
á… á… My hobbies would be low-skilled drawing, some poetry. I sink leisure time into playing videogames like Genshin, Warframe, Arknights, sometimes text-based multi-user games of different MUDs varietes.
á… á… My preferred sports are horse-riding, table tennis and rollerskating, you can invite me for a round of blitz chess if you feel likeâ€Šâ€”â€Šbut be warned that Iâ€™m one awfully sour loser. Ouch!
á… á… I know a thing or two about Lua and JavaScript, but still have a long way to go before I familiarize myself even with bare basics. I grow roses and take care of my very own tiny oak grove. And brew raspberry wine! (well, itâ€™s not proper Â«wineÂ» â€™cause mixed with half measure of vodka).
á… á… Got an undeveloped musical taste,â€Šâ€”â€Šwhatever sounds depressive enough is beautiful enough to me. Insomniac (my typical uptime would be around 22:00-10:00 GMT). Got slight delusions of grandeur and short temper, donâ€™t thread on me (much).
á… á… This may all very well sound like a fountain of negativity, but the message behind is I put absolute value in honesty, brutal subtype including. Donâ€™t hesitate to speak your mind freely, it makes dealing with me simpler as Iâ€™m at times painfully slow at taking hints! Englishâ€™s not native to meâ€Šâ€”â€Šyou remember, right?
á… á… For ones whoâ€™ve built the entire personality around modern social justice and queer stuff, you want to avoid me altogether. It will serve inner peace for us both, my gender studies are 13th century level.
á… á… What else to say: I am what I am, another face in the crowdâ€Šâ€”â€Šso generic it hurts. I love to think of myself as brave and self-reliant which is about 88% wishful thinking, lol. I like far-fetched theories and comfortable with edgy jokes. Appreciate nice book recommendations. We might also build a Hogwarts castle together in Lego Digital Designer or IDK think of something else,â€Šâ€”â€Štell me about your idea of fun.
á… á… Hope we can have a great time despite our many differences.'>
