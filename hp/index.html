	<meta property='og:description' content='ᅠᅠHi all. Name’s Maya, yet I’m more accustomed to being called «Itsforme» or just «Its» while online.
ᅠᅠI can do basic communication in English, but often find myself mismatching words or failing to convey a simple idea — excuse me and don’t be too harsh if I freeze dumbfounded once in a while. A little bit of broken French too, so we can try this as well si vous avéz une patience angélique, voilà. However, my mother language is crippling shyness Russian.
ᅠᅠMy hobbies would be low-skilled drawing, some poetry. I sink leisure time into playing videogames like Genshin, Warframe, Arknights, sometimes text-based multi-user games of different MUDs varietes.
ᅠᅠMy preferred sports are horse-riding, table tennis and rollerskating, you can invite me for a round of blitz chess if you feel like — but be warned that I’m one awfully sour loser. Ouch!
ᅠᅠI know a thing or two about Lua and JavaScript, but still have a long way to go before I familiarize myself even with bare basics. I grow roses and take care of my very own tiny oak grove. And brew raspberry wine! (well, it’s not proper «wine» ’cause mixed with half measure of vodka).
ᅠᅠGot an undeveloped musical taste, — whatever sounds depressive enough is beautiful enough to me. Insomniac (my typical uptime would be around 22:00-10:00). Got slight delusions of grandeur and short temper, don’t thread on me (much).
ᅠᅠThis may all very well sound like a fountain of negativity, but the message behind is I put absolute value in honesty, brutal subtype including. Don’t hesitate to speak your mind freely, it makes dealing with me simpler as I’m at times painfully slow at taking hints! English’s not native to me — you remember, right?
ᅠᅠFor ones who’ve built the entire personality around modern social justice and queer stuff, you want to avoid me altogether. It will serve inner peace for us both, my gender studies are 13th century level.
ᅠᅠWhat else to say: I am what I am, another face in the crowd — so generic it hurts. I love to think of myself as brave and self-reliant which is about 88% wishful thinking, lol. I like far-fetched theories and comfortable with edgy jokes. Appreciate nice book recommendations. We might also build a Hogwarts castle together in Lego Digital Designer or IDK think of something else, — tell me about your idea of fun.
ᅠᅠHope we can have a great time despite our many differences.'>
